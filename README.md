 Trailer Detection & Assistance System  
Android + Web Application using OpenCV, NDK, and TypeScript

This project implements a real-time trailer detection system using native C++ (OpenCV) and Android, with a companion Web dashboard built using TypeScript. The system detects an identifiable trailer target in live camera frames and provides visual guidance to the driver.


 ⭐ Key Features

 📱 Android (Kotlin + NDK + OpenCV C++)
- Real-time trailer target detection using OpenCV C++.
- High-performance frame processing via JNI.
- Live camera preview with detection overlay.
- Native C++ implementation for optimized performance.
- Automatic frame conversion between YUV → RGB → Grayscale/Canny.
- Modular C++ pipeline for detection customization.

 🌐 Web Dashboard (TypeScript)
- Trailer monitoring interface.
- Live or simulated detection visualization.
- Clean UI with component-based architecture.
- API endpoints for posting processed frames or detection metadata.
