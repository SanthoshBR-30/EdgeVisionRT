# 🚗 Trailer Detection & Assistance System  
Android + Web Application using OpenCV, NDK, and TypeScript

This project implements a real-time trailer detection system using native C++ (OpenCV) and Android, with a companion Web dashboard built using TypeScript. The system detects an identifiable trailer target in live camera frames and provides visual guidance to the driver.
